    <h1>About the Marine Ecosystem</h1>
    <p>The marine ecosystem is a vast and complex network of organisms and environments that exist within Earth's oceans, seas, and other saltwater bodies. It encompasses a diverse array of habitats, from the sunlit surface waters to the dark depths of the abyssal zone, and from bustling coral reefs to expansive open ocean expanses. This ecosystem supports a staggering variety of life forms, from microscopic plankton to massive whales, and plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate, nutrient cycles, and atmospheric composition.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Marine Ecosystem</h2>
        <div class="importance-item">
            <p><strong>Climate Regulation:</strong> Oceans play a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing and storing large amounts of heat and carbon dioxide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="importance-item">
            <p><strong>Food Security:</strong> Marine ecosystems support a significant portion of the world's food supply, providing protein-rich seafood that is essential for the diets of billions of people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="importance-item">
            <p><strong>Biodiversity Hotspots:</strong> The oceans are home to a vast array of species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="importance-item">
            <p><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Marine ecosystems contribute billions of dollars to the global economy through industries such as fisheries, tourism, shipping, and offshore oil and gas extraction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="importance-item">
            <p><strong>Cultural and Recreational Value:</strong> The oceans have profound cultural significance for communities around the world, providing a source of inspiration, recreation, and spiritual connection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="importance-item">
            <p><strong>Medicinal Resources:</strong> Marine organisms have long been a source of medicinal compounds and pharmaceuticals.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h2>Example: Coral Reefs</h2>
        <p>Coral reefs are one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet and provide a striking example of the importance of marine ecosystems.</p>
        <p>These underwater ecosystems support a vast array of marine life, including fish, invertebrates, and algae, and provide essential ecosystem services such as coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and fisheries support.</p>
        <p>Coral reefs also have immense cultural value for coastal communities and are popular destinations for ecotourism and recreational activities such as diving and snorkeling.</p>
        <p>However, coral reefs are under threat from human activities such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction, putting their biodiversity and ecosystem services at risk.</p>
        <p>Protecting coral reefs and promoting sustainable management practices is essential for safeguarding their ecological, economic, and cultural importance for future generations.</p>
